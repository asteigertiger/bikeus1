						<p class="title">"We are the third generation to inhabit this space. During the 70′s a bunch of artists moved in. In the 80′s some musicians and film people moved in that knew the artists. In the 90′s a biker that knew the musicians and film people that knew the artists moved in. The stage was set. The 90′s were a whirlwind of bikes, music, film and art in the hood."

						"People saw that we had more fun and less talk, and they liked that. We showed them that you don’t need a mountain or an ocean to ride a bicycle and have fun. Bicycles are freedom, get some."
